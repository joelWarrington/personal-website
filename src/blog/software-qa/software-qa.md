What goes into making a good application? Is it those cool animations?

## What is Quality Assurance?

> <b>Quality Assurance</b> is a program for the <b>systematic</b> monitoring and <b>evaluation</b> of the various aspects of a project, service, or facility to ensure that <b>standards</b> of quality are being <b>met</b>.

In other words, quality assurance is a practice which will ensure quality is measured quantitavely and not qualitatively.

### What does that mean exactly for software development?

- <b>Expectations</b> are <b>described</b> accurately and quantitavely
- Easy to mesure <b>success</b> and calculate <b>ROI</b> <i>(return on investment)</i>
- Increased customer <b>satisfaction</b> & <b>retention</b>
- Positive product <b>reputation</b> & <b>percpetion</b>

## What is a software bug?

- The software <b>doesn't do</b> something it <b>should</b>
- The software <b>does</b> something that it <b>shouldn't</b>
- The software does something that's not planned
- The software doesn't do something that should be planned
- The software is difficult to understand, use or is slow

### Why do they occur?

1. Developers don't understand the specification

2. The design is outdated by the time it's implemented

### What's the cost?

- Reduced customer satisfaction & retention
- Negative product reputation & perception
- Increased financial cost to repair perceptual damages & resolve issues

## How does quality assurance impact cost?

- Design errors account for approximately 80% of the total cost of errors (INSERT REF)
- Every dollar spent in design saves 5 dollars spent on testing and maintenance
- Based on an average $250 million software project, each 1% reduction in bugs results in savings of $1.5 million
